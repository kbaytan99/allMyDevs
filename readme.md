<h5>3. Heading Tags (H1-H6)</h5>
Heading tags are HTML tags used to identify headings and subheadings within your content from other types of text (e.g., paragraph text).

<h5>4. Image Alt Attributes</h5>
The image alt attribute is added to an image tag to describe its contents.

Alt attributes are important in terms of on-page optimization for two reasons:

Alt text is displayed to visitors if any particular image cannot be loaded (or if the images are disabled).
Alt attributes provide context because search engines can’t “see” images.

<h5>5. Nofollow Attributes</h5>
External/outbound links are the links on your site pointing to other sites.

Naturally, these are used to refer to proven sources, point people towards other useful resources, or mention a relevant site for some other reason.

<h5>6. Robots Meta Tag</h5>
A page-level robots meta tag with content=“noindex” attribute instructs the search engines not to index any given page.

The rel=”canonical” link tag is a way of telling search engines which version of a page you consider the main one and would like to be indexed by search engines and found by people.

<h5>9. Social Media Meta Tags</h5>
Open Graph was initially introduced by Facebook to let you control how a page would look when shared on social media.

It is now recognized by LinkedIn as well.

Twitter cards offer similar enhancements but are exclusive to Twitter.

Here are the main Open Graph tags:

og:title – here you put the title which you want to be displayed when your page is linked to.
og:url – your page’s URL.
og:description – your page’s description. Remember that Facebook will display only about 300 characters of description.
og:image – here you can put the URL of an image you want to be shown when your page is linked to.
Use the specific social media meta tags in order to boost how your links look to your following.

<h5>10. Viewport Meta Tag</h5>
Viewport meta tag allows you to configure how a page would be scaled and displayed on any device.

Commonly, the tag and the value would look as follows:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
